# DayToDayFinalVersion
for CMPE133
*HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM*

1)Download the GitHub

2)After, use Command Prompt

3)When using the Command Prompt specify where DayToDay is by copying the file path where it’s located and putting it on the CMD
Example: “cd C:\Users\capta\Desktop\DayToDayFinal-master” on CMD

4)After specifying the location of DayToDay hit enter and then on the new line write “pip install -U -r requirements.txt”, 
this will take the requirements.txt in the DayToDay folder and install it, it’s the requirements needed to be able to run DayToDay.

5)Then just wait a while until it’s finished installing, then when it’s done on the new C: line write “python DayToDay.py”, 
that’s the command used to run the application.

6)After the command is done, there should be a URL starting with “http”, probably going to be numbers, then just copy it and 
open it on your browser and you should be able to start running the final demo.

7)EXTRA STEP IF “python DayToDay.py” didn’t do anything. If nothing happened when putting “python DayToDay.py” in the new line 
but the “pip install -U -r requirements.txt” did work and installed in the one before, then just go inside the DayToDay folder you downloaded and click on 
the DayToDay python file (DayToDay.py) located in the main file just under Config.py and above flasktest.cfg, and that should open up the link for you in CMD and just copy and paste it to your browser 
to open the demo.

(The final project report doc contains the same detailed instructions to run it but includes some pictures so it might be easier
to run it through that guide)
